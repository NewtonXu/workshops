## Grading Guidelines
Notes:
- You will be assigned three notebooks to grade, make sure you at least grade two. Three would be ideal, your colleages will thank you.
- Be nice :)

### Instructions:
1. Review the solution notebook - linked in the instructions for the week ahead
2. Compare the notebook with the solution and look for places you find something new to learn
3. Use the following table for grading. 

| Grade  | Expectation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 10  | The notebook contains solutions to all the cells and beyond  |
| 9   | One small cell is incorrect or missing |
| 8   | Few small cells are incorrect or missing |
| 7   | Few important cells are incorrect or missing |
| 6   | Several cells are incorrect or missing |
| 5   | Half of the notebook is incorrect or missing |
|... | ... |
| 1   | No cells are completed |

Use your judgement according to the difficulty of the notebook to define:
- small vs important
- few vs several
